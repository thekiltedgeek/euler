Repo for Project Euler examples

This is a sandbox for learning/testing various aspects of web development using the Project Euler questions.

The overall idea will be to put each question on it's own separate page.  It will start out very basic using straight up anchors, etc., but over time should become more complex as new concepts are learned and added.
